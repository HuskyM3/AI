Instructions:
1. Copy template-TimeTabling.SPEC to TimeTabling.SPEC
2. Add missing constraints.
3. qsolver.py TimeTabling.SPEC | ./showtimetable.perl
4. Check that the schedule satisfies ALL requirements.
5. If not, iterate from 2.
6. Only submit after the schedule is perfect.

For testing purposes you can reduce e.g. the number of groups,
to make the schedule easier to verify.

Reducing the number of time slots from 8..12 may make
it impossible to find a schedule.

Increasing the time slots e.g. to 8..13 or 8..14 makes
finding schedules easier.
